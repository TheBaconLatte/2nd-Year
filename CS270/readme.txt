NAME OF THE GAME

Americaw

AIM

The main purpose of our game is for entertainment. It is designed to be used as a time waster. It is a casual game that draws inspiration from flappy bird. We decided to add visuals of Donald Trump and Bernie Sander's faces in light of the recent news that Trump has been elected the Republican party nominee by default in the US presidential elections. We encourage players to help save Americaw by attacking Trump 50 times, one time for each of the 50 states. We decided to have the user play as an eagle in homage to the American bald eagle attacking Trump in a photoshooot.

The user must avoid attacking Bernie much as the sparrow peacefully landed on his podium during a rally.

The target audience for this game is Bernie Sanders supporters, Donald Trump opposers, or people who simply enjoy a casual game to pass the time. The age range would be early teens and young adults as we feel that age range would most appreciate the satirical nature of the game. 

NOTE:The audio for this game does not work in the Firefox web browser. Google Chrome works.


DESCRIPTION

The main aim of the game is for the eagle to fly into Donald Trump's face and avoid Bernie Sanders' face as it appears on the screen. There is a "Trumps trumped" counter on the top left of the screen that keeps track of the score. The player must attack as many Donald Trump faces as they can to earn points. If they end up hitting Bernie, the "Lives" counter on the top right of the screen will be decreased by 1. Each player is given 3 lives to start off with. If the lives drop down to 0, the game will stop and "Game Over" will appear on the screen. If the score reaches 50, the player wins the game.


HOW TO PLAY

1. Control the eagle using the arrow keys on the keyboard
2. Fly into Donald Trump as his face appears on the screen
3. Avoid Bernie Sanders by controlling the eagle using the arrow keys
